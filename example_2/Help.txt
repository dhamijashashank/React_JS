// Its mandatory that class name should start with caps letter 
// import React from 'react';
// import ReactDom from 'react-dom'
// in return we are using some tags of html but not all tags of html 
// in return the outer most tag must be present only single time , if we write it more then 1 then it throw exception.
//some of working tags are <p> , <div> , <h1> .....<hn> , <section> etc 
// class is reserved keyword for cs6 only
// we have to extend React.Component with every component.
// One file can contain many classes.
// its mandatory that every class has render() method and it will return html
// at the end of class we need to call render method of ReactDom class.
// parameter of render methord of ReactDom are : class name in following syntax <className/>
// second paramter of render method is refrence object of HTML object where we want to display data on screen/UI.
//Example "ReactDom.render(< Final />, document.getElementById('root'))"
// some keyword are reservesed which we cann't use in jsx for example insted of using class we need to use className.
// we can write java script also but we need to write in curly braces "{}".
// in class we can create seprate method also and we can easily call these method in render method.
// In Curly braces {} we can call any onther method of same class using this keyword.
// we can use javascript exression only we are not able to use loop / condition like for loop , while loop , if condition etc.
// we can also use of constructor in class , but  it should be before any method.
// in constructor super should be placed at first line so that this component is able to extend React.Component.


For Example_2 
*   For This check Index_1.js
*   Its example of state and prop 
*   Example of state is 
    this.state = {
            lastName: 'Thanks krishna for help'
        }
*   In state we can store value in variable and can access its value in other function of class (using java script) and even outside of the class (using props)
*   Example of props is 
     <ToDoItem details={this.state.lastName}/>  from the class where we define state variable syntax <className parameter_name={this.state.variable_name}> 
       {this.props.details}                     In Another class where we want to access these variable syntax {this.props.parameter_name}
*   For This check Index.js
*   Above example show if we want to pass only 1 parameter /1 variable , but if we want to pass more then one parameter then we have to use below approach:
*   Example for more then one parameter

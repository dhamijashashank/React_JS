// Its mandatory that class name should start with caps letter 
// import React from 'react';
// import ReactDom from 'react-dom'
// in return we are using some tags of html but not all tags of html 
// in return the outer most tag must be present only single time , if we write it more then 1 then it throw exception.
//some of working tags are <p> , <div> , <h1> .....<hn> , <section> etc 
// class is reserved keyword for cs6 only
// we have to extend React.Component with every component.
// One file can contain many classes.
// its mandatory that every class has render() method and it will return html
// at the end of class we need to call render method of ReactDom class.
// parameter of render methord of ReactDom are : class name in following syntax <className/>
// second paramter of render method is refrence object of HTML object where we want to display data on screen/UI.
//Example "ReactDom.render(< Final />, document.getElementById('root'))"
// some keyword are reservesed which we cann't use in jsx for example insted of using class we need to use className.
// we can write java script also but we need to write in curly braces "{}".
// in class we can create seprate method also and we can easily call these method in render method.
// In Curly braces {} we can call any onther method of same class using this keyword.
// we can use javascript exression only we are not able to use loop / condition like for loop , while loop , if condition etc.
// we can also use of constructor in class , but  it should be before any method.
// in constructor super should be placed at first line so that this component is able to extend React.Component.


For Example_2 
*   For This check Index_1.js
*   Its example of state and prop 
*   Example of state is 
    this.state = {
            lastName: 'Thanks krishna for help'
        }
*   In state we can store value in variable and can access its value in other function of class (using java script) and even outside of the class (using props)
*   Example of props is 
     <ToDoItem details={this.state.lastName}/>  from the class where we define state variable syntax <className parameter_name={this.state.variable_name}> 
       {this.props.details}                     In Another class where we want to access these variable syntax {this.props.parameter_name}
*   For This check Index.js
*   Above example show if we want to pass only 1 parameter /1 variable , but if we want to pass more then one parameter then we have to use below approach:
*   Example for more then one parameter is
            this.state = {
            lastName: ['Thanks krishna for help','krishna','hare krishna']   (we can define array in constructor of parnet class and access in other class)

        render(){
            return (
                <ul>
                    {
                        this.state.lastName.map(function(name){
                        return <ToDoItem key={name} deta={name}/>
                        }
                        )
                    }
                    </ul>
                )   
            }
*   Actually we have Array/List of lastName which is store in state and it is accessed in render method s shown in above example , for this we need java sscript and we 
    are not able to use any type of loop in java script here {}, so we have to use map and pass one by one value 

*   We need to pass unique key also other wise it will display warning message , remember key should be unique in above case we have unique value i.e we use it as key.


For Example_3 {}

#  If you want to use this keyword in any other function then you have to bind this keyword otherwise its value changed
    Example of binding this keyword : this.ChangeStatus = this.ChangeStatus.bind(this); syntax : this.clasName = this.clasName.bind(this);

#  Example of declaring state level array of object
            this.state = {
            tasks: [{
               name:"Bulk Milk",
               completed:"false" 
            },
            {
               name:"Bulk Test",
               completed:"false" 
            },
            {
               name:"Alone Testing",
               completed:"false" 
            }
            ]
        }
#  If we want to change value of state variable then follow below approach, you need to use setState method for this purpose.
        ChangeStatus(index){
       var tasks = this.state.tasks;
       var task = tasks[index];
       task.completed = !task.completed;
       this.setState({
           tasks : tasks
       })
       console.log(this.state.tasks[index])
    }

#  If we want to access this to another class then you have to use fat arrow function 
    Example:
                        this.state.tasks.map((task , index) => {
                return <ToDoItem key={task.name} clickHandler={this.ChangeStatus} index={index} deta={task} />
  
#  Example of Onclick Method and fat arrow function are as follow 
    onClick={ () => {
            this.props.clickHandler(this.props.index)
        }} className ={this.props.deta.completed ?'completed' :' '}


For Example_4 {Stateless function}

#   This example will demonstrate how to use stateless function.
#   If there is no state in that function then we make it as stateless function as it will render component only.{basic condition for stateless function}
    For Example: in index.js class ToDoList has there own state then we didn't make it as stateless but in class ToDoItem there is no state then we make it as stateless.
#   How to create stateless function:
        * No class keyword is used , insted of that const keyword is used.
        * example const Class_Name = () => {}
        * we use flat arrow function in it.
        * in this component render method is not there , only return is there which will return jsx.
        
For Example_5 ADD Data to List

#   If user want to add new value in state then we need to push value in it.
    Example of puch :
     tasks.push({
            name:currenttask,
            completed:false 
        })
#   Difference between let and var 
    let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, 
    which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope

#   If there is form and Submit button and we want to execute in both case :1st on click on Submit button (its default) , 2nd on press of ennter key , then add onSubmit={props.addTask}
    in form tag like :<form onSubmit={props.addTask}>.....</form>

#   If we are using stateless function insted of normal class then also we need to import React from 'react' even there is no use of this import.

#   The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur.

        For example, this can be useful when:

        Clicking on a "Submit" button, prevent it from submitting a form
        Clicking on a link, prevent the link from following the URL

#   Explination of flat arrow function:
    ES6 fat arrow functions have a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and lexically bind the this value. Arrow functions are always anonymous and 
    effectively turn function (arguments) { expression } into arguments => expression. If using an expression after an arrow, the return is implicit, so no return 
    is required.

    Example :
    JavaScript Snippet
        'use strict';
        // Filter an array for only odd numbers
        let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

        // Before...
        let es5OddNumbers = numbers.filter(function(number) {
        return number % 2;
        });
        ChromeSamples.log(es5OddNumbers);

        // After...
        let es6OddNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2);
        ChromeSamples.log(es6OddNumbers);

        // Parens are optional depending on the number of arguments:
        let square = x => x * x;
        ChromeSamples.log(square(10));

        let add = (a, b) => a + b;
        ChromeSamples.log(add(3, 4));

        // `return` is implied if using an expression after an arrow.
        let developers = [{name: 'Rob'}, {name: 'Jake'}];
        // Before...
        let es5Output = developers.map(function(developer) {
        return developer.name;
        });
        ChromeSamples.log(es5Output);

        // After...
        let es6Output = developers.map(developer => developer.name);
        ChromeSamples.log(es6Output);

        // Fat arrows change how `this` is handled.

        // Before...
        // In ES5, `bind()` or var that = this; are necessary as functions
        // create their own `this`. We need to store the parent `this` in
        // a variable that can be referenced in the callback or take care
        // of binding ourselves.
        function CounterES5() {
        this.seconds = 0;
        window.setInterval(function() {
            this.seconds++;
        }.bind(this), 1000); // or }.bind(this), 1000) and skip that = this
        }

        var counterA = new CounterES5();
        window.setTimeout(function() {
        ChromeSamples.log(counterA.seconds);
        }, 1200);

        // After...
        // ES6 Arrows instead bind `this` to the immediate enclosing
        // lexical scope:
        function CounterES6() {
        this.seconds = 0;
        window.setInterval(() => this.seconds++, 1000);
        }

        let counterB = new CounterES6();
        window.setTimeout(() => ChromeSamples.log(counterB.seconds), 1200);




For Example_6 Delete Data from List

#   If we want to delete any value from state then we have to use splice function like below 
    syntax : variable.splice(index , number_of_items_to_delete)
    Example : 
        let tasks = this.state.tasks    (copy state variable in local variable)
        tasks.splice(index,1)           (splice i.e. delete specific value )

        this.setState({                 (Replcace local variable to state variable)
            tasks
        })

#   stopPropagation function : 
        The event.stopPropagation() method stops the bubbling of an event to parent elements, preventing any parent event handlers from being executed.

        Tip: Use the event.isPropagationStopped() method to check whether this method was called for the event.
    Example : event.stopPropagation();
